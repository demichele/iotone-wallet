# IOT1 Academy IOTA Developers Course cli-wallet layout

This application is built with [oclif](https://oclif.io/), an open Framework that takes care of the command line interface. 

## Important

This wallet is only meant for educational purposes and does not implement proper encryption on the seed or address validation. 
Do not use this application to interact with seeds with balances on the mainnet. This is meant to be run on Devnet as an exercise to improve your IOTA developer skills. 

## What's on this repository?

The following code will provide you with a framework to start coding the commands to:

- Set a seed
- Get an address to receive tokens
- Get your wallet balance
- Send tokens
- See your active seed

**You will find a step by step guide to do all this in our Developer Course.**
